        <h1>What Do Users Really Want? How to Understand Search Intent and Improve Your SEO</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <p>In today’s digital world, where AI is transforming how users search for information, it’s no longer enough to just appear on Google. You need to understand how users think, what stage of their journey they are in, and what they expect from you.

At GrossiWeb, we analyze modern user behavior and tailor every strategy to your business. Our team helps you stand out exactly where your customers are looking for you!
</p>
<h2>How Do Users Really Think When Searching Online?</h2>

        <p>The psychology behind searches is influenced by goals, emotions, urgency, and expectations. In the past, users typed short keyword-based queries into Google. Now, many go straight to AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, or DeepSeek. This shift transforms how they think during a search and redefines “search intent” as something more conversational, contextual, and immediate.</p>
        
        <h2>Search Intent: The Forgotten Key in Many SEO Strategies</h2>

        <p>Search intent is the reason behind a query: to learn, find, compare, or buy. Many SEO strategies still focus only on keywords and overlook this crucial aspect. Understanding intent and aligning content accordingly improves both rankings and the user experience.
</p>
        <h3>Main types of search intent:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Navigational</b>: The user knows where they want to go but uses Google as a shortcut. Example: searching “Facebook” or “YouTube” just to access those pages.</li>
            <li><b>Informational</b>: The user wants to learn or solve a doubt. They’re not ready to buy or sign up yet. Examples: “how to build a website,” “what is SEO.”</li>
            <li><b>Transactional</b>: The user is ready to act—buy, register, download, subscribe, etc. Example: “buy a house” or “sign up for Netflix.”</li>
            <li><b>Commercial Investigation</b>: The user is comparing options before making a decision. Example: “best camera for beginners,” “iPhone vs Samsung comparison.”</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Role of AI in Changing Search Behavior</h2>
        <p>AI has radically transformed how users interact with the web. They expect fast, personalized, natural-language answers. For SEO, this means creating content that not only ranks well, but also serves AI models: clear, structured, and intent-oriented.</p>
        
        <h2>Aligning Your SEO Strategy with Modern Search Intent</h2>
